#First, we create an array of students:
students = [
{name: "Dr. Hannibal Lecter", cohort: :november},
{name: "Darth Vader", cohort: :november},
{name: "Nurse Ratched", cohort: :november},
{name: "Michael Corleone", cohort: :november},
{name: "Alex DeLarge", cohort: :november},
{name: "The Wicked Witch of the West", cohort: :november},
{name: "Terminator", cohort: :november},
{name: "Freddy Kreuger", cohort: :november},
{name: "The Joker", cohort: :november},
{name: "Joffrey Baratheon", cohort: :november},
{name: "Norman Bates", cohort: :november}
]

#Then, we print a list of students using the print_header
#and print(names) methods.
def print_header
  puts "The students of Villains Academy"
  puts "-------------"
end

def print(students)
  students.each do |student|
    puts "#{student[:name]} (#{student[:cohort]} cohort)"
  end
end

#Then, we print the number of students.
def print_footer(names)
  puts "Overall, we have #{names.count} great students"
end

#Finally, we call each method to ensure the results
#are outputted for the end user.
